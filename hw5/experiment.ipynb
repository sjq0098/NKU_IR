    "# 昇腾PyTorch实战：bert-base-chinese应用\n",
    "\n",
    "## 实验简介\n",
    "\n",
    "bert-base-chinese是一种基于 BERT架构预训练的语言模型，它包含了 12 层 Transformer 编码器和 110 万个参数，可以用于各种中文自然语言处理任务，如文本分类、命名实体识别、情感分析等。使用 `bert-base-chinese` 模型时，可以将其作为一个特征提取器，将输入的文本转换为固定长度的向量表示，然后将这些向量输入到其他机器学习模型中进行训练或推断。也可以对 `bert-base-chinese` 进行微调，将其用于特定任务的训练。\n",
    "本实验将简单使用bert-base-chinese 对文本进行向量转换以及掩码预测。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 实验目的\n",
    "\n",
    "- 了解bert-base-chinese的使用方法；\n",
    "\n",
    "## 背景介绍 \n",
    "\n",
    "它使用中文维基百科数据进行训练，通过掩码语言模型和下一句预测两个预训练任务学习语言表示。该模型具有12层Transformer编码器，能够捕捉文本中的复杂关系。其目的是提供一个强大的基础模型，可通过微调应用于多种中文自然语言处理任务，如文本分类、命名实体识别和问答系统等。这一模型的推出显著提升了中文NLP应用的效果。\n",
